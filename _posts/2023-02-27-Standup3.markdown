The scraper had a few issues, namely that it was crashing if the state of the browser wasn't exactly as expected. This week I worked on adding redundancy through a bunch of try/except blocks, making sure to always return the state to where it was supposed to be after refreshing or restarting the driver. With this improvement, the script ran until I recieved an error sayign `('Connection aborted.', ConnectionResetError(10054, 'An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host', None, 10054, None))`, which either means my script crashed, or the website I was scraping refused my connection. But regardless, in our company's weekly meeting we decided to change how we will fill our database, so the items I was able to scrape will be used for testing purposes (I will perhaps make duplicate items to attempt to fill in what was missing after the connection got terminated).

My next steps will be to set up the Azure database, and after completion of that, transition to working on the frontend.
